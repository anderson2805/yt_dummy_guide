{% include callout.html text="GitHub pages uses Jekyll natively, so when I make documentation, I typically
look for Jekyll templates. Why? Using Jekyll means that I can use Markdown,
and allow for users to easily contribute, and build automatically just by
way of pushing to a main branch (or general GitHub pages)." %}
